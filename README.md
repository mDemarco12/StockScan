Hello, welcome to StockScan. This program uses pandas, pandas data_reader, and yahoo_fin APIs to collect current market data for analysis.
The current version of StockScan will function exclusively with securities in the SP500, but with slight modification, can be leveraged for other indexes. 
As a word of advice, please run this jupyer notebook. The Py file is stable but I find it easier to use this program with Jupyter Notebook.
Also, as of writing this README, yahoo_fin has changed a parameter for line 11, and this can cause issues. I am in the process of finding a solution that can maintain...
... the current implementation of "yahoo_fin", but worst case scenario I will switch to "yfinance". 
If you got this far, thanks for stopping by. This program is open-source, so feel free to use and modify the code. 
Thanks for your time and have a good day!
